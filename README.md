# CAD_Analyzer
This App will help you analyze your CAD data. 
Use in combination with any data visualization tool for best results.
Enjoy!

Step 1:
Prepare your data: in the CAD file all the dates need to have the format DD/MM/YR 00:00:00 (eg. 1/7/2017 8:03:36 AM). Save the CAD in the format that you prefer (we support .xls, .xlsx, .csv). 

Step 2:
Edit the Instructions file with the required information. This should be self explanatory. Everything on the right of the ":" should correspond to either a column in your CAD or any meaningful quantity as explained in the file itself.

Step 3:
Edit the table with the list of units. Itâ€™s important that the column names are spelled exactly as shown (Engine, Rescue, Truck, Other). 

CAD_analyzer.py -> Your file to run.
driver.py -> The file that does the real job.
cad.py -> several functions useful to anayze the CAD

Run!
